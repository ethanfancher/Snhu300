Problem: The problem being solved in the projects for this course is to develop an advising assistance software for the Computer Science department. The software should be able to read and parse course data, store it in a data structure, provide functionalities to print course lists and course information, and offer a user-friendly menu for interaction.

Approach: To solve this problem, the approach typically involves designing and implementing data structures to efficiently store and manipulate the course data. The chosen data structures should align with the specific requirements of the software, such as fast searching, sorting, and retrieval of course information. Understanding data structures is crucial because they provide the foundation for organizing and managing data effectively.

Overcoming Roadblocks: While working on the activities or project, roadblocks can occur, such as challenges in reading and parsing the file, handling data structures efficiently, or implementing the menu functionality. Overcoming these roadblocks often requires a systematic approach of debugging, researching, and consulting relevant resources like documentation or peers. It's important to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks and tackle them one at a time.

Expanded Approach: Working on this project likely expands your approach to software design and development. It provides hands-on experience in analyzing requirements, designing data structures, implementing functionality, and handling user interactions. It also promotes a problem-solving mindset and encourages considering factors like efficiency, scalability, and maintainability in the design process.

Maintainable, Readable, and Adaptable Programs: Through this project, you can learn good practices for writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code. This includes following coding conventions, using meaningful variable and function names, writing modular and well-organized code, and incorporating comments and documentation. Additionally, you may explore techniques like code refactoring and design patterns to improve the structure and maintainability of your programs. These practices contribute to the long-term sustainability of the software and make it easier for others (and yourself) to understand and modify the codebase when needed.
